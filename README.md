# Feed-Forward-NN-Phase-1

## Description
In this project, at first, we implement a Feed Forward neural network from scratch using the NumPy library. In the second part, with the help of the codes of the first part, we train several neural networks on the given data and we check the effect of some parameters in the learning process.

## Dataset:
We work with a KMnist dataset (abbreviated as Kuzushiji-MNIST) containing 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images and 75,000 images of 20 different classes or characters, representing one syllable in the Hiragana script (the words using  They are built (similar to an Alfia).
